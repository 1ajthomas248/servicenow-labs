# ServiceNow Help Desk Labs

This repository documents hands-on labs completed using a Personal Developer Instance (PDI) of ServiceNow. The purpose of this project is to gain practical, job-relevant experience with the ServiceNow platform in preparation for entry-level IT support and help desk roles.

The labs focus on core IT Service Management (ITSM) workflows commonly used in enterprise environments, including incident handling, user and group administration, service requests, SLA awareness, and knowledge management. Each lab is designed to mirror real-world help desk scenarios rather than purely theoretical exercises.

### Lab Overview

### Lab 01 – Incident Management Fundamentals
Focuses on the full incident lifecycle in ServiceNow, including ticket creation, impact and urgency–based prioritization, assignment to support groups, escalation from Tier 1 to Tier 2, and proper resolution and closure. This lab establishes a foundation for understanding how help desk tickets are handled in enterprise IT environments.

### Lab 02 – Users, Groups, and Roles
Covers the creation and management of users, assignment groups, and role-based access. This lab simulates a tiered support structure and demonstrates how ServiceNow aligns users and permissions with organizational IT responsibilities.

### Lab 03 – Service Catalog and Requests
Introduces ServiceNow’s service catalog functionality by creating and submitting common IT requests such as password resets, software access, and equipment requests. The lab highlights the difference between incidents and requests and how structured services improve efficiency.

### Lab 04 – SLAs and Priority Management
Focuses on Service Level Agreements and how response and resolution targets are enforced in ServiceNow. This lab demonstrates how SLAs are tied to priority, how breaches occur, and how SLAs influence escalation and accountability in support operations.
